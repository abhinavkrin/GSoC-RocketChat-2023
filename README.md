I worked on a project called [EmbeddedChat](https://github.com/RocketChat/EmbeddedChat) which is an in-app chat solution that utilizes the RocketChat chat engine through its REST and real-time APIs to support powerful chat features like reactions, online presence, typing status, threads, and much more.

I would maintain this repository as the final report summary of my GSoC 2023 project and a quick guide for all future GSoC aspirants.

## ‚≠ê Project Abstract
The goal of the project is to make a ready-to-use chat solution that could be integrated into any website, web app, or app. This project was a major refactoring and enhancement for the EmbeddedChat 2022 project.

## üö¢ Deliverables
- Improve authentication - support all OAuth services
- Move to a mono repo - auth, api, react, react-native, HTML embed
- HTML embed feature
- Theming
- Improving API
- Support for slash commands

## Demo

### Sneak Peak
EmbeddedChat integrated into my esportsweb.in website.
